# John-Lemons-Haunted-Jaunt
TEAM: Liam Dauphinee, Elias Faris, Jordan Whiteley

Our team decided to have each member do the entire JohnLemon tutorial for learnin purposes. We then worked together on the scrips for parts 2 and 3, and did individual particle effects for part 4.

CHANGES: 

The game ran as intended in both Unity and the WebGL build.

This repo should have everything, but if there is an issue or I am missing something let me know. Thanks.
